<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently studying at the School of Computer Science, Ocean University of China (OUC), where my supervisor is [Gao Feng](https://oucai.club/fenggao), and I am part of the [OUC AI Lab](https://oucai.club/). Since June 2025, I have been conducting academic research as a visiting scholar at Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo (EIT), under the supervision of [Xiaoyu Shen](https://person.eitech.edu.cn/xxkxyjsxb/sxy/main.htm), focusing on Streaming Multimodal Large Models for video understanding.

My research interests encompass a diverse and interdisciplinary range of topics, including data-driven ocean prediction, computer vision, video generation, diffusion models, and streaming multimodal large models. I have published some papers with total google scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zk2uLXoAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
